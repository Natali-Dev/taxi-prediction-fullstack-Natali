# taxi-prediction-fullstack-Natali
Labb OOP 1

A project for predicting. The backend and frontend will communicate thru an API-layer to make the components decoupled. The application will serve a ML-model and make relevant predictions. 


### About the columns: 

- Distance (in kilometers): The length of the trip.
- Time of Day: The time of day the trip started (Morning, Afternoon, Evening, or Night).
- Day of Week: Indicates whether the trip took place on a Weekday or Weekend.
- Traffic Condition: Categorical indicator of traffic (light, medium, heavy).
- Passenger Count: Number of passengers for the trip.
- Weather Condition: Categorical data for weather (clear, rain, snow).
- Trip Duration (in minutes): Total trip time.
- Fare Amount (target): The cost of the trip (in USD).


### Ideas: 
- check if bad weather == more bookings/higher fare (rain = more trips)
